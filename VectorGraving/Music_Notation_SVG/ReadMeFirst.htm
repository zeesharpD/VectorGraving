    <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML markup language, designed for
     creating images for web browsers initially. By now, there are many other
     programs that can read, manipulate and produce SVG files. If you are
     unfamiliar with coding, don't be intimidated. Markup languages are among the
     easiest to learn, and with the files I provide, the most difficult parts are
     done for you.</p>
    <p>For an introduction to SVG, try:</p>

    <p>Independent of my musical endeavors, I began learning SVG in 2004, fascinated 
     by the ability to create images on a computer without any special program;
     just a text file and Firefox. Being a guitarist, composer, transcriber, I tried
     a number of music notation programs, and was always disappointed. It didn't take
     me long to start playing with the idea of using SVG. I had already created a
     bitmap library of music symbols, so off I went. One of the great things about
     SVG is, there is no limitation on what symbols you have and what they look like,
     or how they are placed; a huge advantage over the programs I tried. SVG is mostly
     limited by your imagination and your knowledge of the language, and like most
     things, the more you use it the easier it gets. I believe I've gotten to the
     point where I can turn out a piece of music faster than I could have using a
     program, and nothing that I want in it is missing.</p>
    <p>I've named the process VectorGraving.

     As I began this for myself, most of the original library is for standard guitar
     notation. The updated library is for multiple staff systems, including symbols
     rarely, if ever, used in guitar notation. Not all symbols are represented yet; I
     create them as I need them. The work on both libraries is on-going.</p>
