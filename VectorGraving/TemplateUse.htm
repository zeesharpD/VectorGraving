  <h1>Staff Templates</h1>
  <p>This is the code for a single staff template, title page. There are many
   programs that can display/produce SVG, but these files use the 'xml:base' attribute
   which links the staff paper to the libraries. The only program I know of
   that still supports it is <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/">Batik</a>,
   which is fortunate, as I had already chosen it as the most reliable validator of xml,
   and converter to pdf, png, tiff, jpeg.
  <p>The 'viewBox' attribute of the &lt;svg&gt; element is not necessary. I use it so
   'batik' will open the file 'fit to window'. Otherwise it will open at the upper
   left-hand corner at full size. The 'xml:base' attribute links to the music library.</p>
  <img width="793" height="430" src="staffTP-1.png" alt="source"/>
  <p>The &lt;metadata&gt; element is not necessary either. It will not translate as
   'document properties' in a PDF file. I use it to preserve information for the
   original file. If you want to use it, go to:&nbsp;
   <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">
    https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/
   </a>
   &nbsp;for additional attributes you might want. And, of cource, fill in the
   values of the &lt;rdf:Description...&gt; with you're own information.
   Dates are yyyy-mm-dd. Otherwise, you can delete the whole block.</p>
  <p>The &lt;defs&gt;<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- - - -<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/defs&gt;<br>
   block is where the CSS style (for a 'stand alone' svg), and definitions of figures/groups
   that you create (if any), that are not in the library are placed. Nothing in this block
   will render (show) on the page, unless you call it with a &lt;use.../&gt; in the following
   sections of the file. I don't recall the exact message, but a few years ago, servers started
   issuing warnings (errors?) about having links to other xml files when both have internal css.
   I now have all of the css from both libraries and the staff templates placed in a single
   seperate file: 'munocss.css'. I left this image of the old usage here because it's still
   a good example of what's in munocss.css.</p>

  <p>When useing 'Batik' for converting SVG to PDF, stick with pixels for font sizes.
   Batik triples the size of fonts in 'points (pt)' when converting to 300dpi (could be a bug).</p>

  <p>A &lt;desc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/desc&gt; is a more prominent way of including
   information in the file, rather than using a comment: &lt;!--&nbsp;&nbsp;--&gt;.
   The contents of both will not render on the page.<br>
   The &lt;g...&gt;...&lt;/g&gt; above is a simple blank example of a figure
   that might occur frequently in a piece: note, beam, note. Some music will not
   need any pre-defined figures; others may need many.<br>
   I discovered that slurs that are both flipped and rotated will distort.
   Moving the 'translate' out of the 'matrix' solves the problem.</p>

  <p>The &lt;image.../&gt; here is my initials at the upper left-hand of the page.
   You can replace it with you're own, or a logo, or whatever you want,
   or delete it altogether.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This is the main section of the page. Remember to save your templates by
   'save as' and the new name of the file you're creating! Here you will need to include
   and alter some things before you start adding music. This example has my own 'G'
   clef shown. There are three other clefs to choose from in the library: treble/G,
   alto/C, and bass/F. This would be for a single staff page, as here. The two staff
   system templates have a treble and bass clef included, which can easily be altered
   if you need it. After choosing a clef, choose a key and time signature, and place
   them alongside or below the staff and clef. Refer to&nbsp;
   <a href="munolib2_index.htm" target="_blank">
    Music Notation Library Index
   </a>&nbsp;for positioning. Next put in the number of beats and measures you need,
   and the correct number you've decided on for the start of each measure:
   &nbsp;"translate( ,0)". Refer to&nbsp;
   <a href="./Music_Notation_SVG/musMan-4.htm" target="_blank">
    Music Notation SVG page 4
   </a>&nbsp;for a guide. Notice that the staff has no x="" y="", and the clef has
   only an x. This is because the first staff's position in the body is 0,0. The clef
   is at x="216" because the first staff is indented. Clefs, time signatures, bar lines,
   and others, are pre-positioned for y in the library. You only need x and, or y when
   an item is other than 0.</p>
  <img width="844" height="433" src="staffTP-5.png" alt="source"/>
  <p>The block between the comment is empty 'use's' for copying and pasting below
   the 'beat' comments. The contents can be whatever you want or need. The top one
   has an 'xml:base' for anything defined in this file. Replace 'this' with the name
   you've given this file. The bottom one (slur) has 'matrix' (for flipping) included 
   because it comes-up often. You would never use all of these properties at once.
   They're here to make them available. Any property that is not needed can be deleted.</p>
  <p>Beginning with staff 2 there is a text element for the measure numbers that
   appear on the page, and empty parenthesis '()' to be filled in with measure numbers
   for internal navigation.</p>
  <img width="595" height="254" src="staffTP-6.png" alt="source"/>
  <p>The first text element here is what I use for the 'identifier' and copyright of the music
   I typeset. It's at the lower left corner of every template. Use it for you're own information, or delete it. 
   The 'use' is my Vector Graving trademark. I would appreciate it if you would leave it here.
   The second text element 'group' -between the comments- is for additional information about the music.
   It's at the lower right corner of all but the title pages. It's only intended for the last page,
   but you never know which template will be a last page untill you typeset a piece of music.
   You can delete it for all intermediate pages, or delete it all together if you don't want to use it.
   If you do use it, remove the comment start and end tag. The 'polyline' is a temporary border
   so you can see that you're text is inside the page margins. </p>
